Usage
=====

TSSpredator needs so-called wiggle or graph files in order to predict TSS from RNAseq
data. TSSpredator does not provide methods to compute these from raw fastq
reads. In order to generate these, we recommend to use the pipeline READemption [4],
which is described in section :ref:`reademption`.
