TSSpredator - A TSS prediction and classification tool
===================================

TSSpredator is a tool for the comparative detection of transcription start sites (TSS) from RNA-seq data. It can integrate data from different experimental conditions but also from different organisms on the basis of a multiple whole-genome alignment.

So far TSSÃ¼redator has been successfully applied to many data sets generated using the so-called dRNA-seq protocol by Sharma~{\em et al.}, 2010~\cite{sharma2010}. 
In addition we have started using it on RNA-seq data produced with the protocol by Ettwiller~\cite{cap} or Innocenti~\cite{tag}.
In this UserGuide we will concentrate on dRNA-seq data, in section :doc:`otherprotocols` we will give a short overview of how to use TSSpredator on data produced by that protocols.

##**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for #cooks and food lovers
#that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
#It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database #<https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
#and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

#Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further #information, including
#how to :ref:`installation` the project.
